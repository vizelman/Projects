**Project 1** 
https://github.com/vizelman/Projects/blob/main/Using_Pandas_to_Analyze_Flight_Data.ipynb

This projects goal is to demonstrate the following:
(1) make use of Python’s Pandas library
(2) add, remove and transform data within a data frame
(3) generate basic summary statistics and graphics as part of exploratory data analysis work

The data set we’ll be using is a 20,000 row subset of the hflights package provided within the Rprogramming language and sourced originally from the US Bureau of Transportation Statistics:https://www.transtats.bts.gov/DatabaseInfo.asp?DB_ID=120&Link=0

The data set contains information and metrics for commercial domestic (USA) airline flights that departed from 2 separate airports located in Houston, TX (IAH and HOU) during the 2011 calendar year.
A summary / description of the data set can be found here:https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/hflights/hflights.pdf
